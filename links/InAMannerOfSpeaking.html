            This work is an irony of the current post-colonial language situation in Kazakhstan. The people on the recordings who are perfectly “speaking” Kazakh are Kazakhs, who do not speak at all  or speak at a very basic  level.
            The videos have been manipulated using Deepfake technology so their mouths move convincingly as they speak that language which they don`t speak in a physical reality. So to say, within this media they are having an alternative persona who speaks its mother tongue…in a virtual space.
